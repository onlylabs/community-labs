Jenkins is an open-source automation server that facilitates the process of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) in software development. With Jenkins, development teams can automate repetitive tasks such as code compilation, running tests, and deploying applications, which accelerates the development cycle and improves software quality. It is a highly versatile and widely used tool in the industry to optimize workflows and boost efficiency in application development.

During this laboratory session, we will cover:

- Why we need automation in Software development?
- Create Simple Job in Jenkins
- Pipelines with Jenkinsfiles
